The Google matrix P is a model of the internet.

P_ij is nonzero if there is a link from webpage i to j.

The Google matrix is used to rank all Web pages.

The ranking is done by solving a matrix eigenvalue problem.

England dropped out of the top 10 in the FIFA ranking.

tmg - Text to Matrix Generator 
  tmg parses a text collection and generates the term - 
  document matrix.
  A = tmg(FILENAME) returns the term - document matrix, 
  that corresponds to the text collection contained in 
  files of directory (or file) FILENAME. 
  Each document must be separeted by a blank line (or 
  another delimiter that is defined by OPTIONS argument) 
  in each file. 
  [A, DICTIONARY] = tmg(FILENAME) returns also the 
  dictionary for the collection, while [A, DICTIONARY, 
  GLOBAL_WEIGHTS, NORMALIZED_FACTORS] = tmg(FILENAME) 
  returns the vectors of global weights for the dictionary 
  and the normalization factor for each document in case 
  such a factor is used. If normalization is not used tmg 
  returns a vector of all ones. 

  [A, DICTIONARY, GLOBAL_WEIGHTS, NORMALIZATION_FACTORS, 
  WORDS_PER_DOC] = tmg(FILENAME) returns statistics for 
  each document, i.e. the number of terms for each document. 
  [A, DICTIONARY, GLOBAL_WEIGHTS, NORMALIZATION_FACTORS, 
  WORDS_PER_DOC, TITLES, FILES] = tmg(FILENAME) returns in 
  FILES the filenames contained in directory (or file) 
  FILENAME and a cell array (TITLES) that containes a 
  declaratory title for each document, as well as the 
  document's first line. Finally [A, DICTIONARY, 
  GLOBAL_WEIGHTS, NORMALIZATION_FACTORS, WORDS_PER_DOC, 
  TITLES, FILES, UPDATE_STRUCT] = tmg(FILENAME) returns a 
  structure that keeps the essential information for the 
  collection' s update (or downdate).
