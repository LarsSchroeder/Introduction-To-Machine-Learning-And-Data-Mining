\chapter*{Conclusions}
Summing up our work, we observed that K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm is the best method for letter
classification on our dataset. Neural networks also gained good results, however they could be made
more precise applying deep neural networks with doing computations on GPU. Some of our methods
were a way better than these presented by previous researchers.
