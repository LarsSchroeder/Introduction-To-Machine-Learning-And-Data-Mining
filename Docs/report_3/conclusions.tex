\chapter*{Conclusions}
Clustering on our data seems to be quite hard problem to solve, however we managed to apply  GMM and hierarchical methods succesfully. Quality of clustering raises with the amount of data, but it is too computationally demanding for us to run these algorithms on full data set. \\

\noindent We applied association mining and we found some high-support rules such as  x-box $\rightarrow$ width  which confirm our previous findings of correlation between attributes.\\

\noindent We applied outlier detection using different metrics, and by setting an appropriate threshold we identified several outliers, constituting about 0.5\% of our dataset.
