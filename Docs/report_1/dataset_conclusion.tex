\chapter*{Conclusions}
Using statistical and visualization methods, we gained a basic
understanding of the data stored in choosed data set. We investigated 
the feasibility of classification and other methods of data analysis.
We found out that choosed data set is ideal for classification engines,
especially for a machine learning. Other methods such as clustering,
association rule discovery or anomaly detection could be also nicely 
applied to our data. We had only problem with regression which seems to
be pointles to apply it to this data set. 

We discovered that attributes are mostly normal distributed and a 
distribution of classes in data set is nearly uniform. Variance of values
of the attributes ranges between 3 and 8 and value range is 0 to 15.

Principal component analysis showed that first three PC's generate more
than 50\% of the variance, and we need more than 9 PC's to explain 90\%.
Because of this fact we found useful to visualize our data as points in
3D build of first 3 PC's of earch data record. It seems to be a good 
visualization because of the ease of distinguishing letters by points
describing them.
